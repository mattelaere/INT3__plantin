          <p class="anonymous__more__p1">Plantin’s press often printed books without clear authorship. Many of these
            works contained themes of love and inner
            spirituality, ideas associated with the Family of Love.</p>
          <p class="anonymous__more__p2">Some titles in his records were later linked to the sect, even though they
            didn’t openly challenge Catholic teachings.</p>
          <p class="anonymous__more__p3">For example, Plantin printed devotional books that avoided political or
            religious disputes. These texts mirrored the
            Family of Love’s focus on peace and inner faith.</p>

    <h2 class="motive__h2">Why would Plantin take the risk?</h2>
    <div id="balance"></div>
    <p class="motive__p1">Plantin’s ties to the Family of Love may have been motivated by both personal beliefs and
      business interests. The sect’s
      ideas about peace and spiritual love may have appealed to him, especially in a time of religious violence.</p>
    <p class="motive__p2">On a practical level, Antwerp was full of religious refugees and dissenters. Printing texts
      for groups like the Family
      of Love could have been a profitable venture, even if it meant taking risks.</p>

  <section id="alibi" class="alibi__section">
    <h2 class="alibi__h2">The Polyglot Bible: Plantin’s Shield</h2>
    <p class="alibi__p1">Despite the suspicions, Plantin managed to avoid severe punishment. His greatest defense was
      the Polyglot Bible, a
      massive project funded by King Philip II of Spain.</p>
    <p class="alibi__latin">Latin</p>
    <p class="alibi__hebrew">Hebrew</p>

    <p class="alibi__aramaic">Aramaic</p>
    <img class="biblia__sacria" src="./assets/img/bibliasacria.png" alt="picture of opening page bible">
    <p alibi__p2>This masterpiece, completed in 1573, showcased Plantin’s loyalty to the Catholic Church. It included
      texts in Hebrew,
      Greek, Latin, and Aramaic and was seen as a triumph of Catholic scholarship.</p>
    <p class="alibi__p3">The Polyglot Bible’s success protected Plantin’s reputation. It allowed him to keep his
      position as Royal Printer, even
      as questions about his other activities lingered.</p>

    <h2 class="verdict__h2">A Complicated Legacy</h2>
    <p class="verdict__p1">Was Christophe Plantin a secret supporter of the Family of Love, or was he simply a clever
      businessman willing to take
      risks? The truth remains unclear. His connections, printing choices, and ability to avoid punishment suggest a man
      deeply involved in the religious and intellectual debates of his time.
    </p>
    <p class="verdict__p2">What is certain is that Plantin was no ordinary printer. He was a survivor, balancing faith,
      business, and secrecy in a
      time when a single misstep could cost everything.</p>
    <p class="verdict__p3">What do you think? Was he innocent, or was he guilty?</p>
